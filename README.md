# Music Player

My favourite Javascript project yet! A music player that plays 3 songs from my favourite playlist I loved studying with. This project contains a separate file with the music data stored.

## Features
- **Album Cover**: A rotating album cover giving the effect of a vinyl player.
- **Glass-style container**: The Music Player container has a translucent glass effect, giving it a unique look.
- **Buttons**: Functional Play, Pause, Backwards and Forwards buttons to change up the songs in the playlist.
- **Progress Bar**: Allows the user to play the song from a desired part of the song and rewind and forward manually.
